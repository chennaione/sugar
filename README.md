# Sugar ORM [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/satyan/sugar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/satyan/sugar) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/satyan/sugar/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/satyan/sugar?branch=master)

Insanely easy way to work with Android databases.

Official documentation can be found [here](http://satyan.github.io/sugar). The example application is provided in the **example** folder in the source.

## Features

Sugar ORM was built in contrast to other ORM's to have:

- A simple, concise, and clean integration process with minimal configuration.
- Automatic table and column naming through reflection.
- Support for migrations between different schema versions.

## Installing

There are four ways to install Sugar:

#### As a Gradle dependency

This is the preferred way. Simply add:

```groovy
compile 'com.github.satyan:sugar:1.3.1'
```

to your project dependencies and run `gradle build` or `gradle assemble`.

#### As a Maven dependency

Declare the dependency in Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.satyan</groupId>
    <artifactId>sugar</artifactId>
    <version>1.3</version>
</dependency>
```

#### As a library project

Download the source code and import it as a library project in Eclipse. The project is available in the folder **library**. For more information on how to do this, read [here](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects).

#### As a jar

Visit the [releases](https://github.com/satyan/sugar/releases) page to download jars directly. You can drop them into your `libs` folder and configure the Java build path to include the library. See this [tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidLibraryProjects/article.html) for an excellent guide on how to do this.
